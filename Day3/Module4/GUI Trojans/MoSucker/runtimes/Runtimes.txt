
Runtimes
======================================================================


The MoSucker 3.0 Client and Edit Server require the following runtimes:

webdl.ocx, mswinsck.ocx, and mscomctl.ocx

All you have to do to install these runtimes is to execute the Runtimes.exe
file included in this folder.


If you would prefer to register these manually then:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download the .ocx files

2) Copy the 3 files in this folder to your system directory.

3) Goto Start > Run and enter the following:

"regsvr32 webdl.ocx" without the quotes. Click ok

"regsvr32 mswinsck.ocx" without the quotes. Click Ok

"regsvr32 mscomctl.ocx" without the quotes. Click Ok

Thats it!

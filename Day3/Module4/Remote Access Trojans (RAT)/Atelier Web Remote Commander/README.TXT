Atelier Web Remote Commander (AWRC) 7.51 release!
=================================

Atelier Web Remote Commander lets you manage and audit servers and
workstations from your local computer and provide remote helpdesk
support.

At first sight, this does not seem to bring anything new to the
arena, since there are very powerful tools in the market that provide
remote connection capabilities with good performance.

However, the very moment you install and try AWRC you will
immediately notice that you are dealing with a completely different
sort of tool.
* AWRC does not require that you install any software on the remote
machine, simply point and shoot. This turns the software particularly
useful for accessing remote machines where no previous preparation
has been made.
* Unlike the competition, AWRC provides lots of powerful tools for
remote management and audit. With such tools you will be able to
perform operations on the remote system that the remote interactive
user himself could only dream about. With AWRC you have the knowledge
and capabilities to do virtually anything on the remote computer!
* AWRC is safe. A remote user, without Administrator privileges, can
not gain higher privileges by controlling AWRC operation on the
remote system.

AWRC works across Microsoft Networks and is able to access
NT-Technology based machines, the requirement being that your log-in
credentials must have Administrator's privileges on the remote
machine or, alternatively, you must be able to supply a User
Name/Password of an account in the Administrator's group of the
remote machine.

AWRC 7.51 requires the following:

* PC compatibles on local and remote systems with Pentium II/III 600
or higher. Pentium/AMD 1000 or higher recommended.
* Works in systems with the minimum RAM recommended for the Operating
System.

Vista (all editions), Windows XP (all editions), Server 2003/2003R2 (all
editions), Windows 2000 (all editions) and Windows NT 4.0 Sp6a operating
systems (all editions). Works both in 32-bit and 64-bit operating system

* If the remote computer platform is Windows XP Professional, the access is
only possible within the classical sharing and security model for local
accounts.
This is enabled from Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Local Security

obtain the same result from Windows Explorer / Tools / Folder Options / View
and uncheck Use Simple File Sharing. In Windows Vista and Windows 7 uncheck
Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended). This reverts you to the classical model
as well.

machine or, alternatively, you must be able to supply a User Name/Password of
an account in the Administrator's group of the remote machine. In Windows
Vista and later, you need to set a Registry value to allow Filtered
Administrators
to connect across the network (see the FAQ in the Help File).
* Microsoft Networks, i.e. Client for Microsoft Networks installed on
both local and remote machines and File and Printer sharing enabled at
least on the remote machine.

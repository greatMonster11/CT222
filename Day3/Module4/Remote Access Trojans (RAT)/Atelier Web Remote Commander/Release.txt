REVISION HISTORY

Release 7.51
Fixes:
* Some unusual screen resolution were not properly captured, one of such cases
happened with screen widths of 1276 pixels in either 4 colors or 24 colors.
* This release is made ready for differentiated automatic updates based on build
type (Standard, CL or PB).

Release 7.50
Improvements:
* A very significant speed improvement, due to a full rewrite of the image
handling routines.
* Included an alert icon which shows up on the remote system during a
connection. (This is for conformance with some corporate policies, upon request
we can still supply customers with a build without the alert icon).

Fixes:
* Solved all outstanding DEP issues, now it should run even on 64-bit server
operating systems with DEP fully enforced.


Release 7.07
Fixes:
* DEP issues mostly on 64-bit Windows could cause crash on launch.
* Ctrl-Alt-Del, keyboard handling and permission related issues.

Release 7.01:
Fix:
* Remote mouse movement issues.

Release 7.0:
Improvements:
* Support for multiple monitors (up to 10 monitors) on the remotely accessed
computer. You can easily select a monitor by using the Monitors drop down
button under the viewer area of the Desktop tab.
* Now, you can produce Control-Alt-Del on Windows 7, Windows 2008 and
Windows Vista remote machines in the same way you did for previous Windows
versions. No Windows settings need to be changed on the remote machine.
* A number of code changes aimed at speed improvement and reducing CPU
utilization and memory usage.
* Encrypted communication has been simplified still keeping security at the
highest level. Key pairs are now generated using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm
and random data from Windows crypto API. There is no need for the user to
enter any secret text to generate key pairs. Asymethric key exchange is done
now in one single cycle.
* And many more details.

Fixes:
* Some windows were placed on the desktop center (instead of screen center)
when AWRC was launched from a computer with multiple monitors.
* Keyboard handler fix, sometimes not possible to type to the remote machine.
* Upgrading a computer from a backup could cause access violations when
running a registered copy of AWRC.

Release 6.2:

Improvements:
* A Connections Log is optionally produced on the local machine, this
was a common request from helpdesk personnel. It is accessible through
a button on the desktop tab.

Fixes:
* Some right-click popup menus had out of context items.
* A few color fixes.

Release 6.1

Improvements:
* The user can select from 2 user interfaces, Windows classic or
Traditional.
Windows Classic is now the default.
* The Update Files item of the File System tab popup menu launches a
dialog with a Remember Last Folder checkbox.

Fixes:
* Web updater.
* SysInfo/General/Operating System identified all Windows Vista
releases as Ultimate.

Release 6.0

Improvements:

* Now, connections can be made to Windows Vista Business, Ultimate and
Enterprise editions as well as to the upcoming new server currently
codenamed "Longhorn Server".
* The software has full support for remote session switching and
logoff/logon maintaining the connection always alive (no need to
disconnect). This functionality is relevant for Vista, Longhorn Server
as well as for XP Fast User Switching (FUS).
* By selecting the new View-Only mode, local mouse movements and
keystrokes are not passed to the remote computer. This is useful for
passive monitoring.
* During a connection, you can disable the wallpaper and aero
composition (Vista) on the remote computer. This enhances speed and
reduces CPU cycles. The previous state is restored while
disconnecting.
* The Configure menu is now within a tab of the main Window, this
improves usability and saves mouse clicks.
* XP Pro FUS compatibility can be disabled from the Configure menu. If
If Fast User Switching Services are disabled or stopped you can still
connect by unchecking the box. The same happens with Windows Server
2003, but here the default condition is disabled - not concerned with
sessions.
* The software automatically detects remote shutdown and disconnects
the connection.
* On remote Windows XP, Server 2003 and later, the software detects
the process of hibernation or stand-by and disconnects the connection.
* Common error messages on the Progress Report box relating to
inhability to connect are now more detailed. We continue to advise
people to read our FAQ either from the Help file or online at
ttp://www.atelierweb.com/rcomm/faq.htm. The FAQ is not extensive but
covers almost every conceivable difficulty. A Vista specific FAQ is
also available,
* The Processes grid reports also on Session ID, User and Domain.
* The Progress Report box displays the time of the event.
* The Sysinfo tab grids can properly report the new Operating Systems
and CPUs.
* Many List type grids can now be sorted by column.
* AWRCAC (AWRC Access Control) is now much more powerful, able to
monitor or block connections even before any user is logged on at the
console.
* We have included in the distribution a software named AWRCKEY. This
software will remove a Registry Key used by pre-AWRC 6.0 purchased
releases of AWRC. If you do not plan to use pre-AWRC 6.0 releases
again you can remove the key with AWRCKEY.
* And many more details.

Release 5.57/5.58/5.59

Fixes:

* Reduced the size of awrexec.exe, the remote service started on
remote system, allowing a faster connection to the remote machine.
* Various access violations, most of them while waiting for a
connection to be established after pressing the Connect button.
* Trying to change the default hotkeys for Ctrl-Alt-Del and Full
Screen might not be possible.

Release 5.55

Fixes:

* Compatibility issues with x64 64-bit Windows releases:
- SysInfo/Processes not showing 64-bit processes.
- Ports Finder feature not providing results.
- Uploading and Downloading files under the File System tab failed.
* Memory not correctly reported under SysInfo/General for systems
with more than 2GB of RAM.
* SMBIOS information for BIOS under SysInfo/General not reported
under Windows Server 2003 SP 1 and x64 64-bit Windows releases.
* SysInfo/Physical Memory Viewer not providing results under Windows
Server 2003 SP 1 and x64 64-bit Windows releases. Addresses in the
range 0x000C0000 - 0x000FFFFF can be retrieve on these systems.

Release 5.52

Fixes:

* AWRC password could not be removed (bug in release 5.51).

Release 5.51

Fixes:

* Sending clipboard contents to the remote machine could fail.
* Double-clicking on a file under the File System tab did not
download it.

Release 5.5

Improvements:

* Now, it is possible to prevent remote users from using the mouse or
keyboard during a connection. Useful, when remote users must not be
allowed to interfere with the work in progress.
* Mouse wheel support has been added. It acts on the remote computer
when the mouse is inside the remote desktop viewer. It acts on the
viewer itself, scrolling it, when the mouse is outside the desktop
viewer; pressing the Ctrl key while moving the wheel scrolls the
viewer horizontally.
* Under the File System tab you can download and upload complete
directory trees in addition to files, previously only files were
allowed. You can opt for downloading and uploading in compressed
format, as previously, (better across the Internet) or in
uncompressed format (faster within local networks).
* Now, most Windows and internal error messages are reported
verbosely.
* The right-click popup menu of the Sysinfo tab has options to save
or
print all the boxes at the same time.
* When checked under Options, the User Name and Password used to
connect are saved in the Registry and will autofill the respective
boxes when the program launches. We do not recommend selecting this
Option when other people not supposed to know your password may have
access to the local computer. If selected, the User Name and Password
boxes change color and a warning is shown when the program closes.
* It is possible to launch AWRC from the command line and make a
connection. The syntax is:
Path\awrc.exe /r=<Remote Host> /u=<User> /p=<Password>
for example:
"C:\Program Files\Remote Commander\awrc.exe" /r=192.168.1.100
/u=Administrator /p=Mypassword
* An Adminstrator can set a Password under Options to prevent other
users from launching AWRC.
* Under Options, you may set a Compression Level for the remote
desktop images. Within a fast LAN it may be faster to use Light
compression, while across the internet you may try the Strong
compression. The default is Normal, which is a tentative compromise
between both.

Fixes:

* eTrust AV and ZoneAlarm 5.5 (based on the same VET engine), may
optionally use on-access AV scanning. This is done not only for files
but, oddly, for inbound network pipes at creation time. The effect is
not transparent and caused connection problems on the computer where
AWRC and the scanner is installed. If the scanner was installed only
on the remote computer there was no problems.
* On the NT winlogon desktop the cursor tended to jump to the top
left corner.
* After a connection and logon on the remote winlogon screen a
console window flashed briefly on the default desktop.
* When downloading files using the popup menu of the File System
page, some temporary files were left behind on the remote system. The
same happened on the local system when uploading files.

Release 5.01

Fixes:

* Immediately after logging to a Windows 2000 Server, a console
window could start popping up over the desktop producing an infinite
flash effect. This problem was not reported for other Windows
releases.
* In some cases, normally after logging in, the keyboard or mouse
could not be used if no window on the desktop had the input focus.
This problem was only seen in Windows 2000 machines.
* The updating functions were not working reliably and we decided not
to provide files for direct updating from 5.0 to 5.01 from inside
AWRC. Users must download 5.01 from the site as usual.

Release 5.0

Improvements:

* Full-screen is now supported, i.e, when selected, the image of
the remote desktop completely covers the screen area of the local
computer. Also, the user can select from the Options to maintain
the remote screen resolution aspect ratio. In this case, if the local
and remote aspect ratios are different no stretching is made (rather
an area of the local screen is left black to compensate for the
different ratios).
* Screen resolution changes on the remote system are automatically
reflected on the local system. This is valid both in normal view and
full-screen modes.
* The remote service started on the remote system is now configurable
from the Options. Configuration allows changing the binary name,
which defaults to awrexec.exe, the service name and the service
display name. The icon of the binary file has been removed as well.
This is a security subject and contributes to the activity becoming
even less noticeable, when this is a requirement. Of course,
the latest AWRCAC release is still able to detect and stop AWRC
(although we may sell, under special circumstances, AWRC special
builds that circumvent the AWRCAC control).
* AWRC supports manual (the default) and automatic updates. When an
update exists, and the user accepts to proceed with it, the new
software is installed directly from the web with no need to run
any setup or install program.
* AWRCAC has been updated in order to deal with cases where the
service and binary names have not the default values.

Fixes:

* When connecting to a Windows XP remote, usually the first keystroke
was not transmitted.
* "Initialization at stage..." errors where not adequately fixed in
release 4.7. This was more evident when you disconnected then
started a new connection to the same system within less than one
minute.
* The exception at 0x00403038, which appeared occasionally during
the disconnect stage, has been fixed.
* Corrected remote Operating System identification of Windows 2003
Enterprise, Standard and Web variants and Windows NT4 SP6 vs SP6a.

Release 4.7

Improvements:

* The remote desktop image is now captured using a more efficient
algorithm. Experiments have confirmed it is now faster in every case,
including on a fast LAN, sending the image in compressed form so we
have removed the option for sending it uncompressed.

Fixes:

* The remote system CPU usage has been reduced but the remote desktop
screen updates are significantly faster.
* Selecting Black and White desktop colors under Options is not
anymore possible. We don't think anyone was using them. On the other
hand 32-bit colours have been added.
* Connections on Domains with heavy loaded servers could fail with
"Initialization failed at stage..." errors. Some antivirus software
scanning network drives contributed as well for the failure.
* Errors appearing on the remote computer Event log when
disconnecting.

Release 4.6

Improvements:

* Launching files through the popup menu of the File System tab can
now be made either using the Local System account, like in previous
releases, or any user account on the remote computer.
When using either the account of the remote logged-on user or the
account you have connected to the remote computer you don't have to
provide the user name and password, you just selected those options
from the popup menu.
Using an user account provides access to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive
of the Registry for that account. This works much like the Windows
RunAs command.
As a side note, programs launched from the AWRC Desktop page always
run on the remote computer under the account of the remote
interactive user.
* A large number of network related information grids have been
added, namely:
- Connections and Listening Ports.
- TCP statistics.
- UDP statistics.
- ICMP statistics.
- Routing Table.
- DNS Servers.
- Persistent Routes.
- IP Statistics/Settings.
- Installed Protocols/Protocol Details.
- Addressing Information Table.
- Net to Media Table.
- Interface Statistics/Settings.
* When the mouse is disconnected on the remote computer, the local
user can still see an arrow mouse cursor for easier navigation on the
remote desktop (this is optional and can be disabled from the
Options).
* Now, you can select the Ctrl+Alt+Del keyboard shortcut with a
larger freedom of choice. A suitable Ctrl+Alt+Del keyboard shortcut
must have at least a pair of keys from Ctrl, Alt or Shift followed by
a letter, number or function key. For example, Shift+Ctrl+F10 or
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+3 are both acceptable.
* AWRCAC (Atelier Web Remote Commander Access Control) has been
updated in order to accomodate the new Network information features.

Fixes:

* When changing to the desktop tab from another tab, full screen
refreshes could stall in some cases.
* Increasing/Decreasing the Font sizes in some grids could cause an
Access Violation.
* On connections to a Windows NT remote computer, the "hand" mouse
cursor tended to replace the "arrow" mouse cursor.
* Attempting connections with the default credentials, i.e, without
entering a user name and password, to a machine where a connection is
not being possible could block the program for a very long time, even
pressing the Abort button. Now, it is set to time out in 60 seconds
and will respond to the Abort button.
* The option "See remote mouse activity" was not consistently
echoing the remote mouse movements. Now, it will (for as long as the
local mouse pointer does not leave the desktop viewer area).
* On the File System tab, selecting	Upload Files then Cancel in
the
Open Dialog will not allow moving away from the File System tab.
* Windows 2003 is correctly identified in the Sysinfo tab.

22nd January 2004 Release 4.0

Improvements:

* AWRC can use strong encryption, Blowfish CBC with a 352-bit key
length, impossible to break by brute force or other means in the
current state of technology. The session key negotiation between
local and remote is performed using Elliptic Curve 160-bit asymmetric
key pairs (equivalent to 1024-bit RSA). AWRC encryption does not
cover the Microsoft Networks negotiation itself.
Shares and Services information are not encrypted as well, since they
are retrieved locally using the Microsoft Networks mechanism. Other
than these, everything else, from the remote screen to chat
conversations are strongly encrypted and unretrievable by anyone
watching the network traffic.
* The Clipboard contents can be sent to the remote computer and
retrieved from the remote computer. Unlike other remote control
software which can manipulate only text, AWRC can send and retrieve
most standard clipboards formats including pictures and sounds. Of
course, private clipboard formats and OLE-aware formats are not
directly transferable from system to system.
* The remote desktop screen can be scaled from 25% to 200% of the
orginal size. Scaling is passed through an antialiasing filter, so
that most of the orginal details are kept. The user can select a
default scaling under Options.
* AWRCAC (Atelier Web Remote Commander Access Control) has been
updated in order to control the new Clipboard feature.

Fixes:

* Mouse flicker can be eliminated in most cases. You must keep
unselected 'View Layered Windows' in the Options (note that by doing
this you will be unable to see the small tooltips in the remote
desktop).


19th March 2003 Release 3.1

Improvements

* Full support for AWRCAC (Atelier Web Remote Commander Access
Control). AWRCAC allows a remote computer to block, filter and log
AWRC operations. AWRCAC defaults to block connections from pre-AWRC
3.1 releases. An evaluation version of AWRCAC is included in the
AWRC distribution.
* The Help file has been converted from the old Winhelp format to
HTML Help format.

Fixes:

* Connections were not possible to a remote computer using an
Administrator's account without a password.
* Connection timeout from the Options was not correctly updated.

6th December 2002 Release 3.0

Improvements:

* Updates from the remote screen are now much faster, almost in real
time. The updates can be received uncompressed (better for 100Mbps
LANs and higher) or compressed (better for slow LANs and the
Internet). The refresh rate can range from Fastest to Paused. The
highest refresh rates are usually well supported by computers above
Pentium 700 Mhz.
* Palette-based as well as 16-bit, 24-bit and 32-bit true-color
screen desktops are supported both on remote and locally, in other
words, images are manipulated in a device independent manner.
* When the remote is using a stock mouse pointer, this is reproduced
on the local machine, otherwise the standard arrow pointer is used
(as in previous releases).
* Ctrl-Alt-Del can now be issued on the default desktop. Previously
it could be issued only on the winlogon desktop.
* Now every keyboard key combination is simulated on the remote
system. This includes international keyboards, however the same key
combination may have different meaning if the remote keyboard layout
is different. Ctrl-Alt-Del has, of course a different key
combination.
* AWRC tabbed interface has been changed allowing for an easier
integration of new features.
* Remote mouse activity can be optionally monitored (monitoring is
selected by default).

Fixes:

* Ctrl-Alt-Del issued on the winlogon desktop used to close the
existing connection.
* Uploading and downloading of large files used to close the existing
connection.
* Corrects wake-up from screensavers, including password protected.

9 October 2002 Release 2.0

Improvements:

* Remote System General Information, including Operating System,
Processor, BIOS, Memory, Display Adapter and Logical Printers.
* Very comprehensive information on Hardware Devices.
* Users and Groups detailed information.
* Password hashes capture.
* Physical Memory Viewer.
* Ports Finder (mapping of applications to open ports).
* Facilities for Chat with the remote machine.
* Very comprehensive remote file system management, including file
copy, move, rename, delete, create directory, zip and unzip as well
as multi-files download and upload.
* Request authorization for remote operations.
* Option to clear all grids on disconnect or leave them untouched.
Leaving them untouched is useful for post-mortem analysis.
* Splitter between upper bevelled pane and bottom panel allows panes
resizing.
* A few enhancements for better integration with Windows XP.
* Help file has been enhanced and integrated into application context
by calling F1.

Fixes:
* Connection timeout can be adjusted from Options menu. This should
solve spontaneous disconnects in low-bandwidth or very loaded
systems.
* All traces of AWRC operation should disappear on remote upon
disconnection. Previously, this was not always the case.
* In most cases data travels compressed between both systems. This
allows a fast data exchange even when the amount of data can reach
very significant levels, namely for the Hardware Devices, Ports
Finder and Users and Groups.
* Self-adjusting Refresh time. When the user selects Auto for the
Desktop Refresh, AWRC will adjust it upwards if the network
conditions do not allow the selected Refresh time.

3 December 2001 Release 1.1

Fixes:
* Improved low-bandwith connections (e.g. Internet) support.
* Downloading large files on slow-bandwith connections (e.g.
Internet) used to break the link to remote.

Improvements:
* Image compression level can be set through Options. High-bandwith
connections work better with low compression levels. The inverse
applies to low-bandwith connections.
